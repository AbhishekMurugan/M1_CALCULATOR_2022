# Requirements

## Introduction
	We will discuss how we write a calculator program in the C programming language. How a Calculator is used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our calculations easier and faster. 
	C which will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder depending on the input from the user.
Users will have the choice to choose the operation. If the user chooses the wrong operation, then they will get an error message.
## Research
	The goal of our project is to provide aids in advancing student understanding without replacing the need for other calculation methods. 
## Features
	A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This Basic calculators in C Can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and modulus.
## Benefits
	This technology allows students to solve problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem.
## Defining Our System
### Explanation
	It has a various type of operation in the calculator so, the user can solve the problem in quickly and it work as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, modulus etc.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
