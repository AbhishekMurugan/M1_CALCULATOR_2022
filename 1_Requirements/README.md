## Introduction
  We will discuss how we write a calculator program in the C programming language. Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our calculations easier and faster. 

C which will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder depending on the input from the user.
Users will have the choice to choose the operation. If the user chooses the wrong operation then he/she will get an error message.
## Work Process
The work process for this project is using the c program to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus and getting the input from user.
## Result
The result for this program is to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus and getting the input from user
